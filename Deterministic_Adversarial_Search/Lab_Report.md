## **Introduction**

In this lab assignment, we explore the implementation and enhancement of
the Minimax algorithm with heuristic evaluation functions for
tic-tac-toe and its application with alpha-beta pruning for chess. The
Minimax algorithm is a fundamental approach in artificial intelligence
for decision-making in two-player zero-sum games, aiming to minimize
potential losses while considering opponent moves.

### **Objectives and Goals**

1.  **Tic-Tac-Toe:**

    -   Implement the Minimax algorithm to enable an AI player to play
        > optimally against a human.

    -   Extend the algorithm to include heuristic evaluation functions
        > to improve decision-making beyond simple win/loss outcomes.

2.  **Chess:**

    -   Implement the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for a
        > chess AI capable of evaluating and making optimal moves.

    -   Compare the performance with and without alpha-beta pruning to
        > demonstrate efficiency gains.

## **Problem Statement**

The objective is to develop AI algorithms capable of playing tic-tac-toe
and chess effectively:

-   **Tic-Tac-Toe:** Develop an AI player using the Minimax algorithm
    > extended with heuristic evaluation functions to handle various
    > game scenarios and make informed decisions.

-   **Chess:** Implement the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
    > to reduce the computational complexity of searching through
    > potential moves, thereby improving the AI\'s efficiency and
    > decision-making capabilities.

## **Background / Literature Review**

The Minimax algorithm, introduced by John von Neumann in 1928, is widely
used in game theory and artificial intelligence. It ensures optimal
decision-making by recursively evaluating possible future game states up
to a certain depth, assuming the opponent also plays optimally. However,
due to the vast number of possible moves in games like chess, Minimax
alone can be computationally intensive.

### **Heuristic Evaluation Functions**

To mitigate this, heuristic evaluation functions are employed. These
functions assign scores to board states based on non-exact measures
(e.g., piece positions, material advantage) to guide the AI\'s decisions
when full depth exploration is impractical.

### **Alpha-Beta Pruning**

Alpha-beta pruning, proposed by Donald Knuth in 1975, enhances Minimax
by eliminating irrelevant branches in the search tree. It maintains two
values, alpha and beta, to cut off branches that cannot influence the
final decision, reducing the number of nodes evaluated.

## **Methodology or Algorithm Description**

### **Tic-Tac-Toe Implementation**

#### **Approach**

1.  **Minimax Algorithm:**

    -   Recursively evaluates all possible moves, alternating between
        > maximizing the AI\'s score and minimizing the opponent\'s
        > score.

    -   Utilizes depth-limited search to manage computational
        > complexity.

2.  **Heuristic Evaluation:**

    -   Enhances decision-making by assigning scores to board
        > configurations based on potential winning positions, blocking
        > opponent wins, and strategic positioning.

### **Chess Implementation**

#### **Approach**

1.  **Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning:**

    -   Extends the basic Minimax algorithm by incorporating alpha-beta
        > pruning to reduce the search space.

    -   Implements depth-first search to evaluate possible future game
        > states efficiently.

### **Pseudocode (Basic Minimax Algorithm)**

> function minimax(board, depth, maximizingPlayer):
>

>
> return evaluate(board)
>
> if maximizingPlayer:
>
> maxEval = -infinity
>
> for each move in legal_moves(board):
>
> board.push(move)
>
> eval = minimax(board, depth - 1, false)
>
> board.pop()
>
> maxEval = max(maxEval, eval)
>
> return maxEval

> minEval = infinity
>
> for each move in legal_moves(board):
