## How to Play

### Tic-Tac-Toe

To play the Tic-Tac-Toe game using the Minimax algorithm:

1. Navigate to the `tic_tac_toe` directory:

    ```bash
    cd tic_tac_toe
    ```

2. Run the game:

    ```bash
    python play_tic_tac_toe.py
    ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play against the AI.
