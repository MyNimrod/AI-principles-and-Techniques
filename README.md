## Project 0

#### Project 0 will cover the following:

- Instructions on how to set up Python,
- Workflow examples,
- A mini-Python tutorial,
- Project grading: Every projectâ€™s release includes its autograder that you can run locally to debug. When you submit, the same autograder is ran.

## Project 1

- Q1: Finding a Fixed Food Dot using Depth First Search
- Q2: Breadth First Search
- Q3: Varying the Cost Function
- Q4: A* search
- Q5: Finding All the Corners
- Q6: Corners Problem: Heuristic
- Q7: Eating All The Dots
- Q8: Suboptimal Search

## Informed Search Algorithm

- Enclosed a Model of a search problem, Traveling Ethiopia. 
- Write a working class that accept any strategy and Traveling Ethiopia problem, and return with a path/s from the initial state to the goal state/s. 
- Use any programming language

## Deterministic Adverserial Search

- Implement the minimax algorithm for the game of tic-tac-toe.
- Extend the minimax algorithm to handle heuristic evaluation functions.
- Implement alpha-beta pruning in the minimax algorithm for the game of chess.
